* software development
	- check if we can convert everyting into SASL hassle black magic: https://1-sim.com/
	SASL uses lua, but adds some additional functionality / interface between Lua and xplane	(brief with the team?)

	- use this: https://www.siminnovations.com/xplane/dataref/

	- https://developer.x-plane.com/datarefs/

* goal
	- fix the custom functionality
	- engine start procedure

> the current custom avionics stuff doesn't work (at all?), or well partially... looking for a fix here!

> todo: research xplane custom api
